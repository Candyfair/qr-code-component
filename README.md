## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS, SCSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was the first time I used SASS outside of of a React project, for which I usually work from a starter model that is already set up for all the extensions I need. I realised that here `styles.scss` had to be pre-compiled and I used the extension [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass) in VSCode to do it.

I struggled a bit to center the main container vertically so I decided to use Flexbox, and that did the job very easily.
